An image-based, learned method for selective tabletop object rearrangement in clutter using a parallel jaw gripper. Our method consists of three stages: graph-based object sequencing (which object to move), feature-based action selection (whether to push or grasp, and at what position and orientation) and a visual correspondence-based placement policy (where to place a grasped object).
